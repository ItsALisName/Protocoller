This is a very easy-to-use "interceptor" of outgoing / incoming Minecraft packets.
Sometimes it is not possible to do anything using standard APIs, with this plugin, you get the ability to intercept packets when they are sent/received and edit them, which greatly expands the possibilities of the plugin developer. You can also create your own packets, which is also simple here, all (almost) Minecraft classes necessary for creating packets are present and deobfuscated, and everything is also adapted for multiversion.
